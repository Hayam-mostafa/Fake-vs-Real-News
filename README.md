# Fake-vs-Real-News

---

## Project Idea:

This project demonstrates a simple fake news detection system that classifies news articles as real or fake. It shows how text feature extraction and dimensionality reduction techniques can affect the accuracy and performance of a classification model.

---

## Workflow:
  
  1. Load and clean the dataset.  
  2. Build a baseline model using raw text.  
  3. Apply TF-IDF to convert text into numerical features.  
  4. Use PCA to reduce the number of features.  
  5. Retrain the model with reduced features.  
  6. Compare results to observe the impact of each step.

## Tools and Libraries Used:

  - *Python* — the main programming language.  
  - *pandas* — for loading and cleaning the dataset.  
  - *numpy* — for numerical operations.  
  - *scikit-learn* — for building the classification model, applying TF-IDF, and performing PCA.  
  - *nltk* — for basic text preprocessing.  
  - *matplotlib* & *seaborn* — for visualizing data and results.

## Goal:

The main goal of this project is to practice how feature extraction (*TF-IDF) and dimensionality reduction (PCA*) affect fake news detection accuracy, and to understand their practical impact on model performance and training speed.
